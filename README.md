# go-fix-exchange
This project aims to build a backend system that can communicate with brokers via the [FIX (Financial Information eXchange)](https://www.fixtrading.org/what-is-fix/) protocol to:
* Authenticate clients
* Subscribe to market data (e.g., order book)
* Send trade orders (buy/sell)
* Receive execution reports
* Simulate or connect to real-world broker FIX gateways


## üß† Key Concepts
| Component          | Description   |
| -------------------|:-------------:|
|**FIX Protocol**    |A messaging standard for electronic trading between clients and brokers/exchanges|
|**Broker**          |The counterparty or gateway that routes client orders to the market|
|**Market Provider** |The source of liquidity (exchange, ECN, etc.)|
|**Execution Report**|A message (35=8) confirming trade status (filled, rejected, etc.)|

## üìå Milestones
### Phase 1 ‚Äî Core FIX Engine
- [ ] FIX logon / heartbeat / logout
- [ ] Parse incoming FIX messages (market data, exec reports)
- [ ] Send outgoing FIX messages (orders, cancel, etc.)
### Phase 2 ‚Äî Mock + Testing
- [ ] Implement mock broker (quickfix-go acceptor)
- [ ] Simulate order book and execution logic
- [ ] Unit test all message flows
### Phase 3 ‚Äî Web + UI Integration
- [ ] WebSocket to push order book + trade updates
- [ ] HTTP endpoint to place simulated orders
